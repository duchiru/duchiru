Hello Github! I'm @duchiru, currently living in Vietnam \
I love creating software that helps us in our daily computer use. I also love a very popular block game: Minecraft and learning to create mods/plugins for it.

Hope you can take a look at [TeamFalco](https://github.com/teamfalco), it's the place where I collab with my friend, @SpikeVN
